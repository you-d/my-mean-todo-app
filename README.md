#my-mean-todo-app

Status : Discontinued   
Reason : Obsolete - Jumping into Angular.JS Ver. 2 and Redux based React.JS   

A fully responsive, single page web application that utilises MEAN stack technologies, and React.JS. The web app itself is a HTML5 canvas based game that allows users to interact with the game through React.JS built User Interface. The plan is to make the game mechanic to be tied to the To Do List section of the web app written in Angular.JS. Therefore front end wise, this web app utilises a mix of Angular.JS, and React.JS code to handle the presentation, and controller layer of the web app.

The web app itself is an ongoing project, however it has already demonstrated following javascript based technologies: - MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.JS, Angular.JS, Node.JS), ES6, and React.JS
- Javascript (ES6), Jquery, and Jquery UI
- React.JS utlising ES6/ES2015 syntax through Babel JS Transpiler
- Twitter Bootstrap
- RESTful API
- Git/Github
- Gulp, and Webpack
- HTML5, HTML5 Canvas, CSS3, and SASS - MVC (Model View Controller) architecture
- Heroku PAAS Cloud Hosting Service - Google Developer Tool / Firebug
